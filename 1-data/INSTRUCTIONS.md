# Data and SQL

1. Connect to the `toy` database using the credentials provided.
2. Write queries to find the following information from the database:
  
  a. What are the top three products by **number of items sold**? You
   need to provide the product names and the sales numbers for each. (Some
   transactions involve more than one item being sold...)
  
  b. What are the top three products by **monetary value**? You need
   to provide the product names and the total value of sales for each (where 
   possible. What might cause a problem? Hint: check some records for December 2022.)
  
  c. Which user was the top spender in December 2022? Provide their
  email address and phone number.

Save your queries to the file `queries.sql`. Save your results in separate text files.

Commit your results and the completed queries, and push them to your GitHub repository.
